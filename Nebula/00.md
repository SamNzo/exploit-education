# Nebula
## level 00
### Prompt
This level requires you to find a Set User ID program that will run as the “flag00” account. You could also find this by carefully looking in top level directories in / for suspicious looking directories.

Alternatively, look at the find man page.

To access this level, log in as level00 with the password of level00.
### Solution
```shell
level00@nebula:~$ find / -user flag00 -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
/bin/.../flag00
/rofs/bin/.../flag00
```

- ``find /``: look recursively from ``/`` directory
- ``-user flag00``: look for file owned by ``flag00``
- ``-perm -4000``: SUID files
- ``2>/dev/null``: remove errors caused by permissions from output

```shell
level00@nebula:~$ ls -l /bin/.../flag00
-rwsr-x--- 1 flag00 level00 7358 2011-11-20 21:22 /bin/.../flag00
level00@nebula:~$ /bin/.../flag00
Congrats, now run getflag to get your flag!
flag00@nebula:~$ /bin/getflag
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
```

The file at ``/rofs/bin/.../flag00`` works too.

> A SUID program is executed with its owners permissions instead of the current users permissions.
